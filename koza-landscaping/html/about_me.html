        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Val, and I recently got into landscaping via a friend. As a HS senior and athlete, my schedule is not the most desirable for many traditional jobs.
            Thankfully, I found landscaping! I love the opportunity to work my own hours, while seeing the fruits of my labor right after the work! My clients also make 
        me look forward to all of my jobs. Helping bring homeowner's ideas to life is such a fulfilling job every time, and the artistry of landscaping is intoxicating. It's like sculpting, but it grows back! I currently work mostly in the Woodinville area,
        but I'd love to talk if you're from outside of the area.
