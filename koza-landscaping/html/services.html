            <h2>Lawn Mowing</h2><br>
            <p>With my trusty troy-bilt mower, I'll be happy to cut down any grass! Best done between March and October, on the seldom dry days that we get here in WA.
                For higher cuts of grass, I'll use my string trimmer. For clean edges, I'll also use my string trimmer and edger, to ensure there's a clean line on your property!

            <h2>Tree Trimming and Pruning</h2>
            <p>Got trees growing up into your house? Want that great view out of your window again? Or just looking to make your trees look nice and neat? 
                This is just the service for you! Trimming is best done in the Winter if looking for a better shape, and in the spring if looking for more fruit.

            <h2>Bush Trimming and Pruning</h2>
            <p>Have your bushes and flowers been growing in an unsighlty shape? They may need some pruning! Pruning helps to ensure a bush grows to be more 
                full every time you cut it back. If you want more growth, trimming in the Winter is your best bet. However, if you want a better shape and to control the growth, pruning/trimming in the summer or spring is the way to go.

            <h2>Leaf cleanup</h2>
            <p>Though the fall colors are beautiful, the leaves that drop on the ground sometimes have got to go! I can rake up all of the leaves,
                disposing of them in a compost bin or bagging them up. Unfortunately, I don't yet have the facilities to remove the leaves myself.

            <img src="../img/mulching_resized.jpg" alt="mulch on lawn">
            <h2>Mulching</h2>
            <p>Do you have a garden bed that was once well-intentioned, but now just home to many weeds? Do you want to get rid of grass to make space for native plants?
                Or, just want to loosen up the dirt for easier planting? Mulching is perfect for these situations. Cardboard is placed under a 4-5 inch layer of woodchips, smothering any plant life under the mulch.
                As the rain, time, and bacteria dissolve the cardboard, the dead plant life with woodchips create extremely nutritious soil for anything you'd like to plant in the mulched area. 
                I'm unable to transport woodchips myself, but I would be able to call in a service for them, if you'd like a larger area mulched.
