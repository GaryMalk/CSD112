                Welcome to Godzilla Tower! This is a fansite dedicated to all things Godzilla. Here, you can read all about Godzilla's 70 year long history and the monsters and robots he shares the screen with. Our name comes from the great 
                Godzilla Tower, a fictional Godzilla-themed amusement park attraction from the film <i>Godzilla vs. Gigan</i> that turned out to secretly be an alien weapon designed to kill Godzilla. We hope you enjoy your time here!

                First stomping onto the silver screen in 1954 with the Japanese classic <i>Gojira</i>, Godzilla (or Gojira, as he's called in his homeland of Japan) is a giant monster or "daikaiju" who has become a symbol of Japan and 
                Japanese film. Godzilla is a massive bipedal reptile who is semi-aquatic, at home in the sea as much as he is on land. His iconic silhouette is easily recognizable for his short snout, long tail, and rows of large spines
                running down the length of his back. Even without showing you a picture of Godzilla, you likely already have a pretty good idea of what he looks like, even if you've never seen one of his films before.

                <p id="historyTwo">
                Godzilla was initially concieved of as a metaphor for nuclear war, a way to confront nuclear trauma from the only country in the world to ever recieve a nuclear attack. This inital version of Godzilla was destructive and
                uncaring, like a natural disaster that could walk. Over time, however, Godzilla would start to change in nature. What was once a symbol of death would become a protector with atomic breath. Godzilla would soon battle all
                sorts of monsters for dominance over the decades to come. Sometimes he would be the hero, such as in <i>Godzilla vs. Megalon</i>, while other times he would return to his role as a villain. No matter what he did on the screen,
                he would remain beloved throughout the world, and continues to be to this day.
