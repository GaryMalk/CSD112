            <h3>Modifications</h3>
            <p>The MK4 Supra underwent extensive modifications to achieve its incredible performance. Some of the key upgrades include:
                <ul>

            </p>

            <h3>Speed Runs</h3>
            <p>One of the most infamous moments in Smokey Nagata's career was his high-speed run on a public highway in the UK in 1998. Despite the danger and legal repercussions, Smokey managed to clock over 200 mph, making his Supra one of the fastest cars ever on public roads. This bold act solidified his reputation in the automotive world.</p>

            <h3>Cost of the Build</h3>
            <p>The cost to build Smokey Nagata's MK4 Supra was astronomical, even by today's standards. The total investment is estimated to be well over $100,000, accounting for the high-end parts, extensive modifications, and countless hours of labor.

            <h3>Comparison to Modern Supras</h3>
            <p>While the MK4 Supra remains a legend, the landscape of high-performance cars has evolved. The new MK5 Supra, though technologically advanced, lacks the raw, untamed spirit of Smokey's creation. Modern Supras focus more on a balanced performance with an emphasis on handling, comfort, and advanced driving aids. However, Smokey's MK4 Supra remains a benchmark for enthusiasts who prioritize sheer power and speed over all else.</p>
