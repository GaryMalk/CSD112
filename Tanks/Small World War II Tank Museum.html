                    <p>During WWII, tanks were essential to modern warfare in World War II, playing a central role in both offensive and defensive operations. Their mobility, firepower, and protection allowed armies to maneuver across a variety of terrains, from deserts to forests.</p>
                    <p>Yet, each nations that participated in World war II has developed their own unique style of design, as well as characteristics. I will be showing you some of the most iconic tanks from Germany, USSR, and Graint Britain. Those nations has played some of the most critical roles in the course of the whole war, and their designs in armored vehicles have definitely impacted the trajectory of it.</p>

                                <p>Due to its excessive weight and time to assemble, only a small number of Jagdtiger was actually used on the battlefield. Yet, it still encountered countless amount of mechanical error that made it almost inoperatable.</p>

                                <p>Soviet T-34 tanks was the first design to utilize sloped armor in its design. The sloped armor enabled it to use less or same amount of material to get more armor.</p>
