                    <h2>History of the Xenos:</h2>

                    <p>Xenos refers to the other intelligent species which inhabit the galaxy alongside humanity. Many, such as the Aeldari, Necrons, and Orks have existed for millions of years, and believe that the galaxy doesn’t belong in the hands of the Imperium of Man. Many millenia ago, life within the Milky Way Galaxy was seeded by omnipotent beings only known as “the Old Ones”. Extinguished in an ancient war known as the “War in Heaven” by the Necrons. It is believed that the suffering and the use of weapons of unimaginable potency during this conflict is the reason the Warp became so unstable and created entities of nightmare. These Xenos Races exist in a galaxy largely controlled by the Imperium, who seeks to dominate them through the extermination of all other intelligent species. Further threatened by the existence and influence of Chaos, these Xenos desperately fight for their continued survival. </p>

                        <p>“Eldrad is the greatest among us. He is the sun which eclipses the light of our stars. He is Ulthwe and the fate of our kind rests in his hands. His eyes are the keenest, no detail goes unnoticed. Four thousand runes can he cast, guiding our path through torment and war, death and salvation. He is the pathfinder, the seeker, the true guide. Even your race has trembled before his might, though you may not have known it. It was he who guided us to the Ork known as Ghazghkull, and commanded us to steer his path to your world of Armageddon. Ten thousand Eldar lives would have been lost if he had not done so. What sacrifice is a million humans for such a cause?</p> 

                        <p>He knows your affairs better than you do yourself. He warned that weakling seer you can Emperor of the treachery of Horus and the strife which would engulf us, just as it engulfed the rest of the galaxy, but your arrogance deafened you to his words. Your stupidity almost destroyed the galaxy, yet you never knew how close the forces of light were to our ultimate defeat. He saw the Great Devourer and warned our kin on Iyanden, even before they had neared our galaxy.</p>  

                        <p>To him all futures are laid out, just as your crude implements of torture are laid out on the cold metal of that shelf. You say we are random and capricious, we say you are vulgar and idiotic. Some of you call us your enemies. All races are our enemy in time. Some of you call us your allies. You are not allies, any more than a butcher’s knife is his ally. You are tools, nothing more. To be used and expended to protect our race, that is your fate.</p>   

                        <p>Your kind think you are so magnificent, yet even now, at the nadir of our power, we can manipulate you, turn you to our ends, as easily as you might pull a trigger and fire a gun. Our time will come again, Eldrad has promised us. Once more you upstart Mon-keigh [subject spits] shall kneel before our power! This time we will not be so lenient! We will exterminate you, every world, every vessel, every one of you! Eldrad has seen the stars stained red with your blood, and it pleases him!</p>  

                        <p> You think us weak, but we will be your doom, children of Earth.”</p>

                    <h2>Craftworld Aeldari:</h2>
                    
                    <p>A species created by the mythical ‘Old Ones’ the Aeldari, also referred to as the ‘Eldar’, is one of the oldest and most technologically advanced species that inhabit the Milky Way Galaxy. Before the fall of their empire, the Eldar were nigh-immortal and all potent psykers, able to reincarnate from the once calm tides of the Warp. However, due to the devastating conflict known as the ‘War in Heaven’ against the ancient Necrons, the Warp was poisoned by the atrocities committed and the negative emotions which flooded into it. Despite seizing victory from the Necrons and their allies, the Eldar lost the ‘Old Ones’ who were driven to extinction by the conflict.</p>  

                    <p>Inheriting what remained of the Galaxy, after the Necrons suddenly withdrew from the conflict and entered hiding for millennia to come, the Aeldari were free to grow their Empire. Left unchallenged by other species because of their might, and with near immortal lifespans, the Eldar, bored of life, began exploring the pleasures of the flesh and descended into depravity. Those who detested what was becoming of their species congregated upon Craftworlds made of a psychic material called ‘wraithbone’ and left behind the old Empire, coming to be known as the Craftworld Aeldari. The psychic might of the Eldar and the depths of their depraved actions over millions of years lead to the birth of the 4th Chaos God, known to the Eldar as ‘She Who Thirsts’, Slaanesh.</p>  

                    <p>The psychic birth scream of Slaanesh, which emerged in the middle of the Aeldari Empire killed billions in seconds, reality was torn asunder to create the infamous ‘Eye of Terror’, a portal into the realm of Chaos, the Warp itself. Hundreds of worlds were sucked into the ‘Eye of Terror’ and the souls which remained upon such worlds were assailed by Slaanesh’s armies of daemons. Since this tragic event, Slaanesh has laid claim upon the souls of all living Eldar, meaning they can no longer reincarnate. With extremely low birth rates they struggle to replace those lost in this era of war.</p>  

                    <p>Those Eldar who fall in battle wear a psychically powered stone called a ‘soul stone’ which captures their soul before it can be seized by ‘She Who Thirsts’. These soul stones are collected in the ‘Infinity Circuit’ of their respective craftworlds, the most holy location on any Craftworld. Inside these Infinity Circuits reside thousands if not millions of souls, prevented eternal suffering at the hands of Slaanesh. In the face of extinction, the remaining Eldar fight to keep the darkness at bay. Surviving the rise of humanity and the expansion of Chaos the Aeldari strive to survive and reclaim their empire of old!</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“Since the time of The Fall, our race has been haunted by what we, in our reckless pursuit of hedonistic indulgence, gave birth to. Through our dreams once overturned worlds and quenched suns, we are now but fitful shadows clinging to the edge of existence. All the stars in the sky cannot blot out the hateful glare of the Red Moon’s Eye. The birthing place of The Great Enemy pulses with all the malice of a daemon that is dreaming, casting its shadow over all we have ever done and all we ever shall. Every twisted strand of Fate and casting of the Runes leads me to this time, to this place, and it is clear that the final battle awaits me at the ancient Crone Worlds. A conflict the likes of which has not been seen since the Mon-keigh warred amongst themselves, and their corpse of a seer fell to his traitorous son. Is coming and all my steps lead towards it, no matter that I walk other paths. I see the stars stained red with the blood of the Mon-Keigh and, though their wars do not concern me and I would gladly let me destroy one another, I know that to avoid this fight is to condemn my race to inevitable doom. And though all I see is darkness, I know that I will not flinch from my destiny.”</p>

                    <h2>Drukhari:</h2>

                    <p>The Drukhari, also known as the Dark Eldar, are the depraved individuals who’s excess and greed led to the downfall of the Aeldari Empire and the birth of Slaanesh. These outcast kin of the Craftworld Eldar live within a pocket dimension called the Webway, which Eldar race uses also uses as a method of quickly traversing the galaxy. Their capital called ‘Commorragh’ is a place of nightmare for all who reside. The Dark Eldar didn’t end their sadistic tendencies after the birth of Slaanesh, and because of this their souls are constantly being drained by ‘She who thirsts’. Therefore, to sate Slaanesh’s appetite for depravity, they are known to raid worlds across the galaxy for slaves. Those they capture are returned to their Dark City where the fortunate are quickly put to death in the Gladiatorial Arenas. Those who are less fortunate are tortured for a little or long as the Dark Eldar Flesh Masters, also known as Haemonculi, desire.</p>  

                    <p>Fellow Dark Eldar are hardly trustworthy, so most drukhari join organizations called covens. These covens are comprised of warriors who constantly seek to advance in their station and have no issue stabbing their allies in the back to claim advancement. The Drukhari are renowned warriors, but fearing their death and subsequent consumption by Slaanesh, they rarity make a show of standing and fighting. They prefer to attack weakened targets through ambush tactics and other ‘cowardly’ means.</p>

Their fodder, however, is not meat and muscle, but the anguish and despair of the weak. The Dark Eldar do indeed drink blood, but also tears, and most sustaining of all the raw essence of pain that they wring out of their captives.”</p>

                    <p>An ancient race, the Necrons, once known as the Necrontyr were a sickly species, succumbing to the rampant radiation of their birth sun. They found that despite developing the technology to escape their solar system, they were unable to escape the curse of their sun. With extremely short lives and no way to cure themselves, the Necrontyr grew bitter and longed for immortality.</p> 

                    <p>Happening upon the ‘Old Ones’ the Necrontyr asked that the ‘Old Ones’ help them gain immortality or at least cure their sickness, they were refused. Enraged, they declared war against the ‘Old Ones’ but were handly defeated. They returned to their empire to lick their wounds when they found new God-like being called ‘The C’tan’. These beings were supplied with mortal forms by the Necrontyr, and in return they offered to give them the immortality they desired. Creating machines capable of ‘biotransference’ the Necrontyr were transformed into the Necrons, beings made entirely out of a living metal called necrodermis they had been stripped of their souls and individual agency. The C’tan then consumed the souls they had stolen. Using their Necron slaves, the C’tan would exterminate the ‘Old Ones’ in an apocalyptic war known as ‘The War in Heaven’. Releasing the Necrons from their control after the war, the C’tan were in turn annihilated and enslaved by the Necrons.</p> 

                    <p>Weakened from the effort of killing the C’tan, the Silent King, leader of the Necrons, ordered his people into burried tombs to sleep until a time when their old enemies the Aeldari and Orks were weakened. Millions of years passed, and now in the current era of the Imperium the Necrons are once again awakening. The Aeldari and Orks are weakened, and the nascent Imperium is scrambling to address this new threat. Seizing worlds with their superior technology, it is only a matter of time before enough Necrons have united under the Silent King before the Galaxy is returned to his grasp.</p>

Squats are not diplomatic by nature, their brutal manners and fierce tempers do not always inspire confidence in men. Eldar regard them as little more than beasts and only barely preferable to Orks. But the Squats care little for the effete ways of men or the mincing delicacies of the Eldar. Squats are robust in body and bluff in manner, and consider other races fragile and lacking in the good, honest Squat virtues of comradeship and directness.” </p>

A hivemind, the tyranids attack in insect-like swarms of chittering creatures. Their tactics revolve around strength in numbers and sabotage when necessary. They will descend upon worlds and once all resistance is snuffed out, it will take whatever materials it desires, all Tyranid warriors remaining on the planet will jump into collection pools of acid to be reabsorbed by the hive fleet in orbit. Once this is complete, they will move on to the next planet, ever advancing.</p> 

                    <p>To ease their advance, the Tyranids send out infiltrators called ‘Genestealers’. These warrior forms will infiltrate the nobility and populace of a world, implanting hosts with an organic device which controls their brains and will change their genetic structure. Over generations, a ‘Genestealer Cult’ will form and much like a Chaos Cult will vie to conquer the world. This disruption is an asset to the Tyranid Fleets that spread throughout the galaxy, only quickened by the work of the ‘Genestealers’.</p>

If a warrior of the fire caste is required to lay down their life in battle to save other lives, then that is considered a worthwhile sacrifice for the Greater Good.

Some of these include the primitive but capable Kroot, the flying and agile Vespids, and the Gue’vesa which is their name for humanity. It is believed that the ‘Ethereals’ might not be omnipotent beings of charity but may instead exercise a form of mind control over those who enhabit the T’au Empire. Only time will tell, and in the meantime the T’au Empire only continues to expand.</p>
