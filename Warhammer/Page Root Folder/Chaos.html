                    <h2>History of Chaos:</h2>

                    <p>The Immaterium, also referred to as ‘the Warp’, is a dimension of reality akin to hell which some technologically advanced species, including humanity, enter with their void ships as a means of expediently traveling across the Galaxy. Within the Immaterium exists malign entities, referred to by those of real space as ‘Daemons’. They feed off the emotions and souls of those intelligent beings which inhabit reality. They will interfere in the realm of reality to gain more power from the consumption of mortal souls.</p>

                    <p>The 4 most powerful gods are referred to as the ‘Gods of Chaos’. Khorne, ‘The Blood God’ is a god which revels in murder, rage, battle, and the waging of eternal warfare. Tzeentch, ‘The Changer of Ways’, is the god of fate, sorcery, and the hope for the future. Nurgle, ‘The Plague Lord’, is the god of disease, despair, and decay. Slaanesh, ‘The Dark Prince’, the god of pleasure, pain, sensation, excess, and desire. These four gods eternally vie for control of the warp but are known to unite against common threats. It was the 4 gods who corrupted Warmaster Horus Lupercal, son of the Emperor of Mankind, to disrupt the Emperor’s plan of starving the gods of their mortal worship.</p>  

                    <p>After the failure of the Warmaster Horus’s rebellion, the followers of the Dark Gods continue to wage war against the decaying Imperium. The Traitor Primarchs and their Legions travelled into the warp and continue to fight in its name after 10 millennia. Warp entities seek to corrupt the loyal servants of the imperium. The nobility of many worlds has been turned against the God Emperor from the whispers of the Dark Gods, denying the Imperium their tithes of resources and plunging their armies into bloody wars of reconquest and pacification.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“What the thick-headed fools with their broken corpse of an Emperor fail to understand is that not only can they never defeat us, but they can not hide or flee or shield themselves from the triumph of Chaos. They are finite and we are unbound, undivided. They must not err, or they fall to heresy. All who fall join our cause. Every imperial fool who dares to open his eyes is a willing recruit. They strive merely to hold back our fury and might, and it consumes them. Thus you can see Chaos is inevitable. We lurk not only beyond their grasp and at their gates; we lurk within the darkness of their souls, on the tip of their tongues, in their tortured dreams. We are them, but freed from the shackles of ignorance. We are them, grown strong... evolved. We are them, but so much more!”</p>

                    <h2>Chaos Space Marines:</h2>

                    <p>The corruption and subsequent rebellion of Warmaster Horus Lupercal exploited divisions in the nascent Imperium. Talented in the realm of politics, the Primarch Horus harnessed the grievances of 8 of his brothers and turned them against his father, the Emperor. Flocking to his banner, these 8 Primarchs purged loyalist elements from within their own Legions. Luring the Loyal Legions of the Raven Guard, Salamanders, and Iron Hands into an assault on fortified positions on the world of Isstvan V, the Traitor Forces of the Iron Warriors, Word Bearers, Night Lords, and Alpha Legion would feign loyalty until the last minute when they would launch their ambush, annihilating the 3 loyalist Legions.</p>  

                    <p>Following this act, the Traitor legions would drive towards Terra, bent on overthrowing the Emperor and placing Warmaster Horus upon the throne. A bloody path was left in their wake, and eventually the 9 Traitor forces would assemble on Terra, besieging the Imperial Palace situated in the ancient Himalayan Mountain Range. It took many years for the traitor forces to force their way through the loyalist defenses, and all the time the once noble legions fell deeper into depravity and corruption. Legionnaires who worshipped the Blood God Khorne, notably the World Eaters Legion, became frothing berzerkers bent on spilling as much blood as possible, be it from their enemies, allies, or themselves. The followers of Tzeentch, such as the Thousand Sons Legion, became obsessed with the pursuit of knowledge even at the detriment of being harmed by the power they sought, some legionnaires being turned into mindless and abhorrent Chaos monstrosities. The followers of Nurgle, like the Death Guard Legion, embraced his gifts of petulance and plague, their armor bursting with growths and disease, their very vessels a nursery for plague and suffering. Finally, the insane worshippers of Slaanesh, infamously the Emperor’s Children Legion, committed atrocities against the population of Terra, becoming depraved patrons of their once noble pursuit of perfection.</p>  

                    <p>Despite their overwhelming forces, the disunified Chaos Forces failed to seize the Imperial Palace. A last-ditch strike by the Emperor and his forces against the Warmaster, at unspeakable cost, ended Horus’s reign of terror and routed the traitor forces with the aid of a loyalist relief forces comprised of Primarch Roboute Guillimans Ultramarines. The surviving traitor legions were hounded in a campaign known as ‘The Scouring’ by the remaining loyalist Primarchs. Driven into a warp portal, known as ‘The Eye of Terror’, the traitor forces escaped their doom to wage an eternal war in the name of the Dark Gods.</p>  

                    <p>In the modern age of the Imperium the forces of Chaos are led by the Sons of Horus captain Abaddon the Despoiler. Under his command they assault countless worlds across the wounded Imperium of Man. During the 13th Black Crusade, Abaddon led an assault on the Fortress World of Cadia, a world dedicated to containing the traitor forces within ‘the Eye of Terror’. After a hard-fought campaign, the forces of Chaos destroyed the planet, causing a spewing of warp energy to slice a rift down the middle of the Imperium. After 10 thousand years, the warriors of the traitor legions are once again closing in on their goal of usurping the weakened Imperium in its time of greatest strife.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“We fight the long war, not through vain notions of duty and honour, but through a far purer purpose; hatred. At the height of our glory we were betrayed and cast out by our kin. Guilliman, Dorn, Sainguinius – these are names I curse. Horus, Perturabo, Angron – these are names I revere, names I would follow to the very end. It is this hatred that has sustained me through the long millennia. I tend it with bitterness. I nurture it with the deaths of my former brothers. For I know that when the end is upon us and Horus is returned, then the false emperor shall be cast down from his sepulchral Golden Throne, and we shall take our rightful place at the side of Horus, the true Emperor of Mankind.”</p>

                    <h2>Chaos Daemons</h2>

                    <p>Daemons are entities of the Immaterium which feed on the emotions and suffering of beings within the real dimension. While many are mindless, autonomous entities, many are not. The 4 dark gods of chaos lead armies of daemons devoted to them and their ambitions. Each lesser Daemon of Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle, or Slaanesh are fashioned in the image of their liege. Khornate daemons are fueled by the desire to take the skulls of their enemies and spill blood in the name of Khorne, the Blood God. Tzeentchian daemons use psychic powers and conspire in unending schemes to further the ambitions of Tzeentch, the Architect and God of Fate. Nurglite daemons seek to spread infection and pestilence as gifts of suffering to the beings of reality in the name of Nurgle, the Plague God. Finally, Slaaneshy daemons seek to spread greed and excess to trap mortal souls in the worship of Slaanesh, the God of Pleasure and Excess.</p>

                        <p>“If my time in the Black Library taught me anything it was – rather controversially – that Chaos is already very much part of us. It deals in the currency of mortal souls and feeds off states of emotions that are in essence natural. Without us there would be no Chaos. Good and evil? Right and wrong? These are binary oppositions that the inhabitants of this galaxy use to comfort and define themselves. I’m afraid much of the God-Emperor's work is done in the grey area in between.”</p>

                    <h2>Chaos Cults and Armies:</h2>

                    <p>The Chaos Space Marines and Daemons are a meagre few who fight in the name of the Dark Gods, it is their cults and armies of devotees who spread their will throughout the galaxy. Bred upon the hatred and prejudice of the Imperium, these dark followers find gods who value their worship in the entities that inhabit the Immaterium. Comprised of rogue mutants, psykers and pariahs that exist on the fringes of society, chaos cults find willing volunteers in the downtrodden of society. Taking up arms, these cults have been known to seize entire worlds in the name of their deities. Gifted with the mutations and ‘gifts’ of their gods, these heretics will willing lay down their lives in service of omnipotent beings.</p>  

                    <p>Influenced by daemons whispers in their dreams, many Imperial Guard Regiments have turned traitor, filling the ranks of their once vile enemies with experienced soldiers. Chaos corruption permeates the galaxy and in the current age, the forces of Chaos find willing supplicants throughout the Imperium and beyond.</p>

It is life that matters and what I have learned is that Chaos IS life, for life is change and destruction and new forms, new mutations ever manifesting. We clung to the Emperor, a dying effigy, because He was all we knew. We feared life. We feared our own potential strength. The Imperium is dying. A slow death, but it’s dying. I did what I had to, that’s all. I opened my eyes and saw what a fool all of us were, bowing to a half-dead failure slumped on a throne. Haha! The blasphemy still sends shiver down my spine. It is the freshness of life. I am given to Chaos now. Now I truly live!”</p>

                    <p>The Dark Mechanicum is a heretical faction of the Horus Heresy era Adeptus Mechanicum which turned against the Emperor and sided with Horus. Disavowing their old beliefs, these heretics experiment freely and corrupt technology with their mere presence. Binding daemons into machines of war, these heretical techpriests create monstrosities of death to unleash upon their erstwhile kin.</p>  

                    <p>Like the Adeptus Mechanicus, the Dark Mechanicum are the primary scientists and engineers of the Chaotic forces. It is their ministrations which create and repair engines of war such as Chaos Titans and Knights which fight their loyalist counterparts. Fueled by the warp, these depraved inventors have released all restraint. They are the cogs in the machine which produce vaunted daemon engines from within the Hell-Forges of Chaos.</p>
