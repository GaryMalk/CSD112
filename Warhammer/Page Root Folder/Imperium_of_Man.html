                    <h2>History of The Imperium of Man:</h2>

                    <p>In the 41st Millenium humanity fights against the dying of the light, in the face of impossible odds and the extinction of their race. The majority of the human race, countless trillions, live within the borders of the Imperium of Mankind. Founded by ‘The Emperor’, this Imperium of Man sought to reunite and safeguard his species against the terrors of the galaxy. This ‘Emperor’ was a mysterious individual of immense psychic power who had subtly guided humanity from the shadows for millennia. It was in mankind’s most desperate hour when he decided to emerge from obscurity to save it. Upon the post-apocalyptic cradle of humanity Terra, once known as Earth, the Emperor began his crusade, uniting the conflicting factions which inhabited the world. He then set out into the Galaxy to rediscover the isolated and ignorant human populations lost in the collapse of the old empires which had originally set out from Terra.</p>

                    <p>In support of armies of common men and women of the Solar Auxilia and the Imperial Navy strode the forces of the Mechanicum and the Emperor’s own gene-enhanced bodyguard, the Adeptus Custodes. The crusade to reunite humanity was instead led by the 20 Primarchs and their Astartes Legions. Demi-god creations of the Emperor, rumored to be soul-binded with minor warp deities, these peerless warriors would be his hammer and chisel, used to craft a better future for humanity. Each of these Primarchs took on an aspect of Humanity in their personalities, an assortment of instincts and emotions of belonging to mankind refined into their 20 persons. Magnus the Red, Primarch of the 15th Legion, held the unrestrained curiosity of humanity and its’ incautious hunger for knowledge, Fulgrim, Primarch of the 3rd Legion, and his Legionnaire sons pursued perfection in all forms of War, Art, and any other task to which they dedicated themselves. These 2 examples provide insight into how the Primarch sons of the Emperor represented humanity’s potential.</p>

                    <p>But this age of prosperity lasted a few mere centuries before the greatest of the Primarchs’, Warmaster Horus Lupercal, the favored son of the Emperor, rebelled against his father at the behest of dark gods which inhabited the Immaterium. Bringing fully half of his brothers and their legions to his banner, an apocalyptic war was waged over the soul of the human race. For ten years this war raged between those Loyal to the Emperor and those who fought for the Warmaster. After the death of many billions, the war concluded upon the world of humanity’s birth. Years of fighting ensued, devastating Terra as the Traitors drew closer to victory. The Emperor decided upon a sudden and desperate assault on the Warmaster’s flagship to cut the head off the rebellion. Accompanied by his sons Sanguinius and Dorn along with contingents of Adeptus Custodes and Astartes legionnaires, the gamble succeeded at incredible cost. Sanguinius was killed by his brother Horus and the Emperor was mortally wounded in the fighting. Carried from the flagship back to the Imperial Palace, the Emperor was placed upon the Golden Throne, an invention of the old Age of Strife, which kept the Emperor alive in agony for the next 10,000 years at the cost of 1000 human souls sacrificed each and every day to ensure he never died.</p>

                    <p>Without the guiding hand of the Emperor the Imperium was placed into the hands of the common man once more. Devastated by their failure to protect their father, the remaining Loyal Primarchs disappeared over the years following Horus’s rebellion. To lead the stagnating Imperium a council was formed, comprised of the most influential organizations that remained. This council of the great and powerful would become known as the High Lords of Terra. Under their reign, the Imperium would no longer expand its territory but would transform into a regime determined to protect what remained through the enforcement of the Imperial Creed, a form of worship towards the Emperor as a deity. Diverging thought would not be tolerated, those who wandered from the set path would be persecuted by the Inquisition, and those worlds which refused to pay their tithes and took up arms against the Emperor would be visited upon with unrestrained wrath.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“In my high seat I gaze into the immaterium and see the shadow that our own universe casts into depthlessness. This eye... this eye sees gentle flows of soul-stuff where the becalmed mind might starve to death, and tides and churns of genius and hate. The warp mocks the power of words to describe. But what I can never turn my back on is the power and the beauty of the Emperor. I see His soul shine out from Earth and His presence fill every corner of the immaterium. I am scorned for what I talk of seeing, scorned by my family – so be it. Some say that every one of us sees a face of the warp meant only for him, a warp that none other shall ever see, but it makes no matter. I have known from the first time I beheld it that I could do nothing but follow that light with my life.”</p>

                    <h2>Adeptus Astartes:</h2>

                    <p>The Adeptus Astartes, also known as the Space Marines, are post-human super soldiers recruited as children by the Imperium, they are implanted with various synthetic organs and indoctrinated to become peerless warriors. Created from the genius of the Emperor, these ‘Angels of Death’ are formed in the image of one of the 20 Primarchs. Inheriting physical, mental, and sometimes psychic traits from their primogenitors, they are the heroes of humanity. </p>

                    <p>Following the tragedy that was Horus’s rebellion, the loyal Primarchs and their Astartes could no longer be trusted by humanity to wield the power they had once been granted. With the introduction of the Codex Astartes written by Primarch Roboute Guilliman, the 9 remaining loyal Legions would have their remaining strength broken into Chapters of 1000 marines. They would each be spread throughout the Imperium so that no one individual could unite or corrupt enough of their kin to threaten Terra ever again.</p>

                    <p>Adeptus Astartes Chapters contain the greatest warriors of humanity. There is a phrase that ‘One Marine can capture a town, a Squad can capture any city, a Company can take any world, and a Chapter can capture any solar system’. Over-looking their allotted sector, Astartes Chapters can be based on upon a world, as the ‘Ultramarines’ are located on the planet Macragge, or they can be a nomadic spacefaring ‘void-based’ Chapter, like those of the ‘Spears of the Emperor’ Chapter. Recruiting from worlds they protect, or those they fight upon, the children recruited by the chapter face the odds of being ascended to the godlike forms of Space Marines. For every 1 child that succeeds in the grueling trials to become Astartes, there are tens if not hundreds that fail, and likely perish. This harsh reality ensures that only the strongest rise to fill the ranks of the Chapter.</p> 

                    <p>Space Marines accept the reality that they will eventually die fighting in the Emperor’s name. In his name they resist the corruption of the Alien, the Mutant, and the Heretic, and they will continue fighting for decades or centuries, for service only ends in death.</p>

They shall be of iron will and steely sinew. In great armor I shall clad them and with the mightiest weapons shall they be armed. They will be untouched by plage or disease; no sickness shall blight them. They shall have such tactics, strategies and machines that no foe will best them in battle. They are my bulwark against the Terror. They are the Defenders of Humanity. They are my Space Marines... and they shall know no fear.”</p>

                    <h2>Astra Militarum:</h2>

                    <p>The Astra Militarum, more commonly known as the Imperial Guard, is composed of ordinary humans who fight in the name of the Emperor. In war the Adeptus Astartes are equivalent to a scalpel, proficient in deep strikes which decapitate enemy leadership as soon as an opportunity presents itself. The Imperial Guard, by comparison, is a sledgehammer. Equipped with massed artillery, tank formations, and mobs of lasgun wielding infantry, the Imperial Guard prefers to fight wars of attrition where if all else fails, they can out die their enemy to victory.</p>  

                    <p>Raised upon countless worlds, often as a form of tithe to the Imperium, many worlds have become famous for the quality of their regiments. Notably the Cadians Shock Troopers, Death Korp of Krieg, Vostroyan Firstborn, and Catachan Jungle Fighters to name only a few. When the courage of a Guardsman fails, the regimental Commissar will administer capital punishment to anyone who deserts. The commissariat is responsible for guarding their regiment against corruption and outbreaks of cowardice by instilling discipline and loyalty in the Emperor’s Name.</p> 
                
                    <p>While Space Marines are the most famous of humanity’s warriors, do not discount the contribution the common man and woman makes in the name of the Imperium!</p>

His war machines will crush you under their treads. His mighty guns will bring the very sky crashing down upon you. You cannot win. The Emperor has given us his greatest weapon to wield. So make yourselves ready. We are the First Kronus Regiment, and today is our Victory Day.”</p>

                    <h2>Adepta Sororitas:</h2>

                    <p>The Adepta Sororitas, also known as the Sisters of Battle, are a military unit comprise completely of female warriors. Fighting under the banner of the Ecclesiarchy, the Imperial Church, these women seek to safeguard the lives and souls of the Imperial citizenry. Raised in the Schola Progenium alongside future commissars and shock-troopers, the Sisters of Battle are trained from a young age to become elite protectors of humanity. Equipped in power armor, and only surpassed in skill by the Space Marines and Adeptus Custodes, these nuns of war are a match for most threats the galaxy will throw at them.</p>  

                    <p>The Adepta Sororitas are formed into several ‘Orders’. Typically stationed upon an Ecclesiarchy World dedicated to the worship of the God Emperor, these faithful warriors are often seen combatting heretics as part of Imperial Crusades and in warbands led by the Inquisition. Acts of faith fueled by the Sisters of Battle’s belief in the God Emperor have produced instances of miracles turning the tides of battle across the beleaguered Imperium.</p>

                    <h2>The Inquisition:</h2>

                    <p>The Inquisition is an organization within the Imperium of Man that exercises near unlimited influence and power. To refuse a request issued by an Inquisitor is as to sign your own death warrant. Planetary Governors, Nobility, Generals and Admirals of the Astra Militarum/Navis Imperialis, Ecclesiarchs and Chapter Masters of the Adeptus Astartes are at the service and mercy of the Inquisition. Such is their influence that an Inquisitor’s choices could spell the doom of entire Sectors of the Galaxy.</p>  

                    <p>Organized into several ‘Ordos’, it is the purview of each Inquisitor to ensure the stability of the Imperium and the annihilation of its enemies. The ‘Ordo Xenos’ focuses on discovering and ending Alien threats to the Imperium. The ‘Ordo Hereticus’ targets concentrations of corruption and heresy that might fracture the Imperium from within. Finally, the ‘Ordo Malleus’ fights against threats from within the Immaterium, especially daemonic incursions and possessions which may lead to widespread disaster if left unaddressed.</p>

Some have called me heartless, ruthless, even cruel. I am not. I am not beyond emotional response or compassion. But I possess – and my masters count this as perhaps my paramount virtue – a singular force of will. Throughout my career it has served me well to draw on this facility and steel myself, unflinching, at all that this wretched galaxy can throw at me. To feel pain or fear or grief is to allow myself a luxury I cannot afford.”</p>

                    <h2>Adeptus Mechanicus:</h2>

                    <p>The Adeptus Mechanicus, also referred to as the Cult Mechanicus or the Tech-Priesthood of Mars, is the scientific, engineering, and technological heartbeat of the Imperium of Man. Technically autonomous from the larger Imperium, the Tech-priests of Mars believe in the ‘Omnissiah’, also the Emperor, who they believe is the prophet of the great ‘Machine God’. In an age where knowledge and technology were lost millennia earlier during the Age of Strife, the Mechanicus is the only organization with the knowledge to keep the existing technology operational. No spacefaring ship, dataslate, vox-system, nor warpdrive would be operational without their expertise. Believing that all existing technology is sacred, the Mechanicus denounces invention as heretical, and seeks only to maintain that knowledge which is already known to it. The most heretical technology is that of AI, also known as Abominable Intelligence.</p> 

                    <p>Most followers of the Machine God are heavily augmented with metal for in their belief ‘the flesh is weak’. Because of this, the Mechanicus relies upon humans to perform all duties of labor or computation. Servitors are human servants who are either cloned or are former criminals who have been lobotomized and heavily augmented with neural devices to control their actions and will.</p> 

                    <p>The armies of the Mechanicus are largely comprised of heavily augmented ‘Skitarii’ warriors specifically augmented and bred for war. Alongside them walk robotic machines whose actions are ‘slaved’ to a nearby techpriest. Some of these constructs are controlled by the brain of a loyal follower of the Machine God who decided to have it transferred to the machine so they would become one with their deity. Towering over the battlefield are the most powerful weapons of the Imperium, God-like constructs called Titans and their smaller kin known as Imperial Knights. These bipedal constructs are tens and hundreds of meters tall and fire devastating bursts of plasma projectiles as well as gatling gun sluggers. Where the Mechanicus marches in war, only ash is left in their wake!</p>

                    <p>The Adeptus Custodes, also known as the Custodian Guard, are near-peerless warriors charged with the protection of the Emperor of Mankind. Where each Space Marine is built upon a template provided by their Primarch’s geneseed, each Custodian is a unique work of art. Where Space Marines fight in squads akin to wolves, each Custodian is a hero unto legend akin, fighting like a noble lion. Numbering only ten thousand at any one time, there are no more elite individuals in the entire Imperium.</p>  

                    <p>Fighting alongside the Emperor during the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy, the Custodians held the breached Webway gate beneath the Imperial Palace on Terra for 9 years, until the wounding and interment of the Emperor upon the Golden Throne. Suffering catastrophic casualties, the Custodians barricaded themselves within the Imperial Palace for the next ten millennium, ashamed of their failure to protect the Emperor. In the current era of the Imperium, with the return of the Emperor’s son, Roboute Guilliman, the Custodes has once again returned to the battlefield. A symbol of the Emperor himself, their meer presence boosts the courage of all faithful citizens who witness them.</p>
