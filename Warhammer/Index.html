                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“It is the 41st millennium. For more than a hundred centuries the Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the Master of Mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of His inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting Carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that He may never truly die. </p>

                        <p>Yet even in His deathless state, the Emperor continues His eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor’s will. Vast armies give battle in His name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst His soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Astra Militarum and countless planetary defense forces, the ever-vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants – and worse.</p>

                        <p>To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.”</p>

                    <p>Warhammer 40,000 is a tabletop franchise created by Games Workshop in 1987. The game’s creators introduced lore to the game to provide players with context and immersion. The in-game factions that were developed have received consistent lore updates since its inception. Those factions can be divided into 3 categories, the servants of the Imperium of Man, the Followers of Chaos, and assorted Xenos. This website was created to simplify the lore for those interested in learning more about the Warhammer 40,000 universe! Let’s start by describing the factions...</p>

                    <p>The Imperium of Man is an authoritative and corrupt administration which controls most of the known galaxy in the name of humanity. The God Emperor of Mankind, figurehead of the Imperium, is a corpse of a man, sat upon a throne of gold to which trillions of souls give worship every single day. Those who rule in his name are willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to ensure his continued survival, and to retain their own influence and power. To live as a common man of the Imperium is to know never ending hardship and oppression. In a time and place of such violence and danger, those in power will not hesitate to sacrifice you, your family, nor your world for the survival of the Imperium and in the name of the God Emperor!</p>

                    <p>The Followers of Chaos are comprised of the entities and worshippers of the Dark Gods which inhabit the Warp, a pocket dimension akin to Hell itself. Mortals refer to the entities of the Warp as Daemons. These entities are fed by the emotions and suffering of mortal souls and are tireless in the pursuit of sating their appetite. The followers of Chaos include mortals who worship these daemons in the hope of gaining great power or ascending to become a daemon themselves. Largely comprised of humans, these lost souls give their lives willingly in service to the boundless ambitions of the Gods and their ‘Great Game’.</p>

                    <p>The Xenos races are the many intelligent species which inhabit the Milky Way Galaxy. Each Xenos species seeks to survive in this unforgiving age of war. Outnumbered by the Imperium of Man and unceasingly assailed by the forces of Chaos, they fight against the odds. Each species has its own goals, whether it is survival, prosperity, expansion, or the annihilation of all life.</p>
