            <b>Types of Yarn</b>
            <br/>
            Sewing thread is commonly used in microcrochets. There are many types of sewing thread, including cotton, polyester (synthetic), or lace. Different types of thread have different characteristics. For example, cotton thread is the most used because it is relatively harder and easier to color, but not as good as polyester, which is not easy to color. Lace thread is glossy and delicate, but not strong enough and softer. I will choose different types of thread according to the items to be crocheted. If you are a novice, I recommend cotton thread.
            There are also different types of yarn. For example, the smaller the number on the DMC brand, the thicker the yarn. Yarn No. 40 is thicker than yarn No. 80. But please also note that different types or brands of yarn have different sizes.
                <br/>
                <br/>

            <b>Hook size.</b>
                <br/>
            There is no fixed crocheting limit when micro-shopping. It depends on personal feelings and crocheting techniques. For example, the Clover Crochet Hook is from 1.75mm to 0.6mm. The smaller the crochet hook, the finer the finished product, but the higher the difficulty. In addition, if the same type of thread is used, but different types of crochet hooks are used, the finished product will be very different.It is usually recommended to start with 0.75mm crochet and No. 20 yarn.
                <br/>
                <br/>

        <b>Coloring and shaping</b>
                <br/>
            For micro-hooks, crocheting is only part of the work, and the subsequent coloring, stitching, and shaping will be carried out according to the crocheted items. This step will make your work more distinctive and more artistic.
            For example, for coloring, you can choose different types of pigments according to different products, such as gouache, pearl powder, acrylic, or fabric dyeing liquid (color ink), etc.
            Stitching and shaping are also important steps, which will add color to your work. For example, lobsters need to make more than 8 different parts separately during the crocheting process, and they need to be assembled after the crocheting and coloring are completed, and the time spent on these steps may be more than the time for crocheting.
                <br/>
                <br/>

            <b>Working environment</b>
                <br/>
            A comfortable environment and light are important for microcrocheters. Too dim or too bright a light source can cause damage to the eyes. In addition, a comfortable chair is also crucial. Special reminder, take regular breaks and don't indulge in them, otherwise, you will feel discomfort in your eyes or body palms.
