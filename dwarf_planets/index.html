        <p>Welcome to Jade's Dwarf Planet Catalog! The goal of this website is to list all known dwarf planets over 10 km, and will be updated as more are discovered.</p>
        <h3>What is a dwarf planet?</h3>
        <p>A dwarf planet is any body in our solar system orbiting the sun and that is spheroid in shape due to its own gravity, and for the purposes of this website, is larger than 10 kilometers in size. This size boundary is in place because we don't know how many there are in the solar system. They are NOT planets, because they have not "cleared" their orbits of debris, as the eight planets have.</p>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>For fun! And also to bring attention to the less-appreciated celestial objects in our solar system, since Pluto is the only one most are aware of, and there are so many more!</p>
        <h3>Where's Pluto?!</h3>
        <p>Pluto is so well known that I decided that it doesn't need to be a part of the catalog, since most people know at least something about it, and this website is intended to draw attention to the other dwarf planets.</p>
