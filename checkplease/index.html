                and foods; but the most common food in Africa is nsima. This website has been created to give the the
                idea of main common food used in Africa, Malawi in particular, with the aim of selling the country to
                the world for people know Africa, but very few know about Malawi and the common food in Africa as a
                whole.</p>

                cooked differntly, it is made of maize flour, yam flour or cassava, depending on culture. But the most
                common one is what is made of maize Flour, and this come in three forms; white flour, cream flour and
