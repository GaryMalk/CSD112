            <h1>Navigating Relationships with BPD: My Constant Fear of Abandonment</h1>
            <p class="author-details">Author: Jessica Little | 22 years old | from Atlanta | Published on: April 2, 2024
</p>

            <p>Living with Borderline Personality Disorder feels like constantly being on edge, balancing between wanting to be close to people and fearing they’ll disappear the moment I let my guard down. The fear of abandonment isn’t just a passing worry—it’s a gut-wrenching certainty that can strike out of nowhere, and when it does, it takes over everything.</p>

            <p>I can’t remember a time when I didn’t feel this way. It’s like no matter how much someone loves or cares for me, there’s always that nagging voice in the back of my mind, telling me they’re going to leave. And I panic. It could be something as simple as my partner being late for dinner, or a friend taking too long to respond to a text. Suddenly, I’m spiraling, convinced they don’t want me anymore, or they’ve found someone else who’s easier to deal with.</p>

            <p>In those moments, it’s hard to think rationally. My emotions become so intense that I act out before I even realize what’s happening. I’ve pushed people away so many times, almost as if I’m testing them to see if they’ll really leave. But then, there are times when I’ll do the exact opposite—apologizing over and over, trying so hard to hold onto the relationship because I can’t bear the thought of being abandoned. It’s exhausting, and honestly, it’s confusing.</p>

            <p>It’s like I’m always caught between desperately wanting to be close to people and being terrified that, if they really see me for who I am, they’ll decide I’m too much. And, in those moments of panic, I feel like I am too much. I start to believe that I don’t deserve the relationships I have, and I start waiting for the inevitable moment when they leave. The problem is, sometimes I end up being the one who pushes them away first—because it feels easier than watching them walk away on their own.</p>

            <p>I hate that I do this. I want to be better for the people in my life. I want to trust them. But there’s always this fear in the background, convincing me that they’ll eventually get tired of me. It’s like no matter how much someone reassures me, there’s always a part of me that doesn’t believe it. It’s hard to explain to people, and I know it’s hard for them to understand. But I want them to know that when I’m scared like this, it’s not because of anything they’ve done—it’s just this constant battle I’m fighting inside my own head.</p>

            <p>Therapy has helped, though. I started seeing a therapist a while back, and it’s made a difference. I’ve learned that these feelings, as intense as they are, aren’t my fault. I’ve been working through Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and it’s been life-changing in ways I never expected. One of the biggest things I’ve learned is how to use mindfulness to slow down when I feel those emotions starting to take over. It’s not perfect, and I still have moments where I slip back into old habits, but I’m learning to take a breath before reacting.</p>

            <p>I’m starting to trust, little by little, that the people who care about me aren’t just going to vanish because of one mistake or one bad day. And maybe the hardest part—I’m learning to believe that I deserve that love, even when it feels like I don’t. That’s a hard one for me. There are still days when I feel like I’m too much for the people I care about, but I’m working on it. I’m learning to ask for what I need without feeling like a burden.</p>

            <p>It’s not easy, and the fear doesn’t just disappear overnight. But I’m starting to see that I can have the close relationships I’ve always wanted without being controlled by this constant terror of losing them. And on the days when the fear feels too big to handle, I remind myself of how far I’ve come. I’ve still got a long way to go, but I finally feel like there’s hope. And for now, that’s enough to keep me going.</p>
