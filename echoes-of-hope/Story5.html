            <h1>Finding Myself: Living with BPD and Reclaiming My Identity</h1>
            <p class="author-details">Author: Emily Carter | 27 | Portland, Oregon | Published on: September 9, 2024</p>


            <p> For most of my life, I felt like a chameleon, constantly changing who I was depending on the people around me. In high school, I would mold myself to fit in with whichever group I was hanging out with—one day, I was the quiet girl who loved reading, and the next, I was outgoing and rebellious. It wasn’t that I was trying to be fake; I just didn’t know who I was. I’d pick up other people’s interests, opinions, even their personalities, hoping that somewhere in the mix, I’d find something that felt like me. <p>
            
            <p> But the problem was, I never did. Every time I thought I had a grasp on who I was, it would slip away, leaving me feeling empty and lost. It wasn’t just in friendships either. I noticed the same thing happening in romantic relationships. I’d start to mirror the person I was dating—suddenly I liked the same music, wanted the same things, and held the same beliefs. I was always morphing into what I thought others wanted me to be, because deep down, I didn’t know who I wanted to be. <p>
            
            <p> This shifting sense of self wasn’t just confusing, it was exhausting. One day, I’d wake up feeling confident, thinking I knew what I wanted from life, and the next, I’d feel like a complete stranger to myself. It was like I was playing a role in someone else’s story, not living my own life. And the worst part? I didn’t even know how to start finding out who I really was. <p>
            
            <p> The breaking point came in my early twenties. I was in a relationship that started to feel suffocating because, once again, I was losing myself in it. I remember looking in the mirror one morning and not recognizing the person staring back at me. That’s when I realized something had to change. I couldn’t keep living like this—constantly shifting, constantly adapting, constantly unsure of who I was. <p>
            
            <p> It was around this time that I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. At first, the diagnosis felt like a punch in the gut. I didn’t want to believe it, didn’t want to accept that this was something I had to deal with for the rest of my life. But as I started to learn more about BPD, things began to click into place. The mood swings, the fear of abandonment, the identity issues—they all made sense now. My constant struggle to figure out who I was wasn’t just in my head; it was part of the disorder. <p>
            
            <p> I knew I needed help, so I started going to therapy and, eventually, found my way to Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). At first, I was skeptical. I thought, *How could mindfulness exercises and skills training help me find myself?* But over time, DBT began to work. It wasn’t an overnight transformation—far from it—but slowly, I started to connect with parts of myself I had never really acknowledged before. I began to notice which things actually brought me joy and which I had just picked up from others. I started listening to my own thoughts and feelings, without immediately dismissing them as invalid or unimportant. <p>
            
            <p> Mindfulness was key in this process. It forced me to slow down, to really sit with myself and ask, *What do I want?* At first, the answers didn’t come easily. I had spent so long living according to other people’s expectations that I didn’t know how to separate their voices from my own. But over time, I learned to tune into my own needs, my own desires. I started rediscovering old passions, like writing and photography, that I had abandoned because they didn’t fit with the people I was trying to impress. <p>
            
            <p> The process of reclaiming my identity wasn’t easy. Some days, it felt like I was making progress, and other days, I’d fall back into old patterns of doubt and self-criticism. But gradually, I began to feel more grounded, more sure of who I was. I stopped needing constant validation from others to feel okay about myself. I learned to trust my own instincts, to believe that my thoughts and feelings were valid, even if they didn’t always align with those around me. <p>
            
            <p> Now, I’m still on that journey of self-discovery. I don’t think there’s ever going to be a moment where I can say, This is exactly who I am, and it’ll never change. But what I’ve realized is that it’s okay to evolve. It’s okay to grow and shift, as long as I’m staying true to myself in the process. Living with BPD means that my sense of self might always be a bit more fluid than most people’s, but that doesn’t mean I’m lost. It just means I’m always learning more about who I am—and for the first time in my life, I’m okay with that. <p>
            
            <p> Reclaiming my identity is a process, not a destination. And while it’s taken a lot of work, therapy, and soul-searching, I finally feel like I’m starting to live life as me—not as the version of myself I thought others wanted, but as the person I’m meant to be. And that, to me, is everything. <p>
