                For the home page design, I created a two column layout so that the information maximizes the area on screen. 
                <br><br>
                I simplified the layout so that it is easier for the user to pay attention to the most important information and for easy reading so that as the user scrolls down they easily transition to the next section. I lowered the opacity of the gray buttons to make buttons easier to find but also so that the text stands out.
                <br><br>
                At the bottom of the page I added a the social media icons as a reminder that the user can find their social media platforms online for more information. I simplified and collapsed information in sections so that the layout is less cluttered.

                <b>The Van</b><br>
                The first official design is the van. If parked or driven around the design is shown to the public, just like the memorable Marbella Design Pink car. I made the text big and visible to other drivers or pedestrians on the road so that it is easy to quickly read and comprehend. 
                <br><br>
                <b>Billboard Sign</b><br>
                I also created a giant billboard sign with and without the van to display the information at a much larger scale. 
                <br><br>
                <b>Mockups</b><br>
                Lastly, I designed two smaller mock ups for the universities Instagram story. I shrunk down the university logo icon and added to their profile image to maintain consistency. It is important to target the audience in many different ways, because it increases the chance of being seen and spread through word of mouth. Second image depicts a user replying to the story asking for more information about the event.
