              Design & Display: Apple is expected to refine the design of the
              iPhone 14 Pro, possibly reducing the notch size or adopting a
              hole-punch display. Display enhancements may include a higher
              refresh rate for smoother animations and improved OLED technology
              for better color accuracy and brightness.

              Camera & Performance: The iPhone 14 Pro's camera system is likely
              to see upgrades, potentially featuring larger sensors, improved
              image stabilization, and enhanced computational photography
              capabilities. Performance-wise, expect a significant boost powered
              by a next-generation A-series chip, offering faster processing,
              better graphics performance, and improved energy efficiency.

              advancements in wireless charging technology, the iPhone 14 Pro
              will offer faster connectivity and more convenient charging
              options. Battery life improvements may come from optimizations in
              hardware and software, ensuring longer usage time on a single
              charge.

              will introduce new features and optimizations tailored to the
              device's capabilities, enhancing user experience and security.
              Apple's ecosystem of accessories, including MagSafe chargers and
              cases, will likely see updates to complement the iPhone 14 Pro's
              features and design.
