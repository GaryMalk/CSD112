            Hello again, I'm Dmitry! 
        </h1>
            <p>
            I'm really into gymnastics, always pushing myself to get stronger and master new tricks. 
            When I'm not training, I'm usually playing Minecraft - building epic creations, crafting, and exploring new worlds. 
            I also love playing board games with my younger brother; we're always challenging each other in strategy games or just having fun. 
            I'm pretty good at math too, so I enjoy solving problems and helping out whenever I can.
            </p>

            I'm lucky to have a really supportive, close-knit family. We spend a lot of time together, whether it's hanging out at home, 
            playing games, or just enjoying each other's company.
            Right now, I'm saving up to upgrade my computer, so I'm offering services to earn some extra cash. Whether it's dog walking, 
            math tutoring, or running errands, I'm ready to hustle and reach my goal!
