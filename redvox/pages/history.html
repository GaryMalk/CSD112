    <h2>Before Red Vox</h2>
     <p> Before Red Vox was created, Vinny was in a different band called Davy's Grey with Mike and another guy named Phil.<br>
    That band broke up in the early 2010s, and the members did other band stuff for a while.
    Sometime in 2014-2015, Vinny and Mike decided to get back together to form a band.
    The band couldnt figure out a name for a while, until Vinny saw the words "Red Vox" on a poster in a dream.</p>
