                        I misjudged how long writing each of these pages would take, so this one's going to be left unfinished.
                        If you're curious, the Vow's deal is that they're the faction which sided with Vihren and lost. They
                        claim he was a liberator who wanted to create a kinder world and those who opposed him doomed everyone
                        to live in a horrible cruel reality. They've vowed to take vengeance, but they can't exactly square
                        up against the other nations because they're all in forests/mountains/hills and the Vow's primarily
                        centaur population are disadvantaged in that terrain, so they're waiting for an opportunity to strike.
