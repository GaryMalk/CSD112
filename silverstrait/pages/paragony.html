                        After centuries of civil war, the elves inhabiting the enchanted forest north of the strait have
                        finally united under a single banner for the first time since they were banished to this dimension.
                        Saint Lanius, military genius and divinely selected champion, has vanquished the last of the corrupt
                        archmage dynasties and ushered in an era of prosperity. No longer does the archmages' arrogance hinder
                        progress by forcing sages to adopt their particular magical tradition alone, nor does their selfish
                        power struggle grant opportunities for foreign enemies to pillage coastal settlements with impunity. 
                        Now, the arcane disciplines supplement each other in confluence with the church's magic to make feats
                        that would have once seemed implausible not only possible, but commonplace. Now, the elves' might is
                        respected by all. And just as a baron rules a barony or a duchess a duchy, their paragon leads the
                        Paragony.

                        Magic is everything. It is the strongest weapon, the keenest spy, the swiftest courier, and so much
                        more. Someone with magic will always be superior to someone without. Thus, the two traits which can
                        be used to obtain it are the Two Virtues: intellect and piety. Arcane academies are more accessible
                        in the Paragony than anywhere else in the world, and the church's doors are always open to the
                        faithful; if one is unable to learn magic in such a place, it is purely because of their own failings.
                        They are Virtueless - beneath the station of the Virtued. Some believe there is a third way to attain
                        magical ability. They are wrong. Power from an infernal pact is not gained, but borrowed with strings
                        attached. It is never in the mortal's favor. It is the opposite of virtue. And it is punishable by
                        death. Such is the only fate for those who willingly consort with the enemies of the angels.

                        Originally exiled from their fey homeland by irrational fanatics who branded science as a sin,
                        then continuously raided by twisted cultists who worship dead monsters through horrifying necromantic
                        rituals, the Paragony is well acquainted with the dangers of blind faith. Instead, it practices
                        rational faith: doctrine based on research and healthy debate rather than authoritative dogma. What's
                        known is that the universe was formed as a cosmic battleground between angels and devils; equally
                        matched, the former seek to preserve, the latter seek to ruin. Neither can directly intervene outside
                        of their own dimensions and thus require mortals to carry out their will, often unknowingly in the
                        case of devils - such as with the aforementioned cultists. And now, a warmongering totalitarian regime
                        which worships the same "gods" has risen to oppose the only angel followers in this dimension. It's no
                        coincidence.
