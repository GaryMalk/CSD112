                        The dwarves have emerged from their centuries-long isolation in the molten mountains south of the
                        strait, rallying with fervor unseen since when they exacted vengeance for their murdered god in the
                        ancient past. They had been complacent as hardship and injustice festered throughout the outside world,
                        but no more. Now they march to build a better future. Every settlement they bring into the fold is
                        made more safe, efficient, and beautiful by their architectural expertise and advanced magitech.
                        The residents no longer toil under the yolk of oppressive and inept regimes. And eventually, there
                        will be no war or widespread suffering at all when the entire map falls beneath their banner. Thus
                        marks the second time a nation has claimed the title of empire. But the Silver Empire fell long ago
                        because it was soft and weak like silver, this one is a refined version, it is an empire of bronze.

                        Art is the highest pursuit. Not feeble paintings or ephemeral songs, but tangible, permanent works
                        that combine form and function, such as architecture, sculptures, and weaponsmithing. Beauty is the
                        meaning of life, there's no pointing in making something that lacks it. Such is the first lesson.
                        The next highest pursuit is invention. Years of concentrated study are required for a mage to learn to
                        cast a firebolt; minutes are required for a layman to learn to shoot a rifle. Magic only improves the
                        lives of a few, technology improves the lives of all. Such is the second lesson. And lastly, flinching
                        is the gravest error. A firm hand is required to properly shape anything, whether it's a sword, a child,
                        or an empire. A shaky grip cannot hold onto what's important. Such is the third lesson taught to the dwarves
                        by their draconic creator.

                        A fourth lesson is derived from their creator god's fate, when the bronze dragon Rakentus was
                        killed by his power-hungry trickster brother, the green dragon Vihren, who sought to absorb the
                        essence of every other dragon and ascend beyond godhood; to ascend to the status once held by the
                        rainbow dragon Cinder, the originator deity who formed the universe and then fully divided their
                        essence tenfold to birth the ten draconic gods. It's further supported by the fact that shapeshifters,
                        the instruments wielded by Vihren in Rakentus' assassination, still carry out Vihren's will in the
                        shadows even after his demise, calling upon his spirit just as the empire calls upon Rakentus'. And
                        it's supported further yet by their conceited, unprincipled, and despotic rival's sickening alliance
                        with these unholy murderers. This fourth lesson is to always stay vigilant.
