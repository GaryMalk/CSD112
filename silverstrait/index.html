                    Two hegemonic powers stand on opposite coasts of the Silver Strait, embroiled in a cold war. A
                    high-stakes game of espionage unfolds within their arms race, both nations avoiding escalation due
                    to one simple fact: neither the wizards and theologians of the Paragony nor the engineers and smiths
                    of the Bronze Empire could conquer the other without suffering enough loses that a previously
                    weaker third party could swoop in and conquer them in turn. Victory isn't enough; it must be decisive.
                    So each side seeks to tip the balance far enough in their favor that they could break the deadlock
                    and invade without making themselves vulnerable. The battle will be won before a single sword is crossed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, regardless of who wins, the historical record will reflect that the heroic saviors
                    triumphed over the villainous dictatorship. There is no universal objective account of the past
                    or present; every side has its own limited, subjective, and unreliable perspective.
